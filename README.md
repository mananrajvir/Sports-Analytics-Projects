Pythagorean Expectation states that 'the win percentage of a team over a season, is proportional to the ratio of: <br/>
```
Square of the points/goals scored by the team divided by the sum of squares of the points/goals scored by the team and its opponent
```
This project explores the use of Pythagorean Expectation in several sports including - Baseball, Cricket and Football. The relation between a team's win percentage and the Pythagorean Expectation value is also studied using regression.

* This project further explores the idea covered in the previous study. 
* I calculate the Pythagorean Expectation value for teams, during the 1st half of an MLB season and use it to predict the team's win percentage during the second half.
* The project analyzes how well the Pythagorean Expectation of the 1st half of the season, correlates with the win percentage of the second half.

This project explores the hot-hands scenario in basketball: <br/>
```
The idea that basketball players can find themselves with a ‘hot hand’ – a streak in which they seem magically to make shot after shot
```
* The project focuses on whether the result/outcome of the current shot can impact the result of the next shot.
* * The idea of hot-hands claims that - the probability of a shot going in, is higher after a previous shot that has already gone in, as opposed to a previous shot that has missed. This claim was first tested by applying conditional probability to an NBA season shot dataset.
* Additionally, the correlation between the outcome of successive shots is also analyzed.

## <a href = https://github.com/mananrajvir/Sports-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Moneyball%20I%20-%20Analyzing%20the%20science%20behind%20Moneyball%20.ipynb> 4. Moneyball I - Analyzing the science behind Moneyball: </a> <br/>
* This project is based on the story of Moneyball in baseball.
* This first part of the project focuses on:
  * Analyzing if the player's ability to draw a walk (after 4 balls), had a statistically significant impact on the team's ability to win.
  * The story of Moneyball emphasizes how Billy Beane, used statistics like Onbase Percentage (player's capacity to draw a walk, as well as their capacity to hit the ball) which were often ignored by other team managers and recruiters.

* This project further explores the story of Moneyball, and the impact it had on Major League Baseball.
* The study explores the relation between players' salaries and the on-base percentage (a metric popularized after the Moneyball book was published). The goal is to see whether MLB teams started giving a higher priority & salaries to players who had a higher on-base percentage.
* The study also analyzes the significance of other metrics like plate appearances, arbitration eligibility and fielding position on the player's salaries using regression.

## <a href = https://github.com/mananrajvir/Sports-Analytics-Projects/blob/main/Identifying%20Underpaid%20%26%20Overpaid%20Football%20Players%20using%20Regression.ipynb> 6. Identifying Underpaid & Overpaid Football Players using Regression: </a> <br/>
* This project focuses on identifying football players who are overpaid and underpaid based on their skills.
* The project uses regression to compute a player's expected wages in 2021, using their FIFA 20 statistics, as well as their current wages.
* For example, the wages for a goalkeeper will be calculated using their FIFA 20 statistics like - Overall Rating, Age, GKDiving, GKKicking, GKReflexes, Current Wage and International_Reputation.
* The predicted wages for 2021 are then compared against the players' actual wages in 2021, to identify players who are overpaid and underpaid.
